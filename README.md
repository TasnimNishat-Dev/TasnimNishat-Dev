## Publication
**Sustainable Waste Management System Using Artificial Intelligence and Satellite Communication: A Case Study | June 2024**
Second Author, Presented at ICAEEE 2024, DUET, Dhaka [Read Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10561816) 
- This conference paper critically analyzes solid waste management (SWM) methods in South Asia, identifying challenges in adopting integrated and satellite-based technologies. It suggests that deep learning (DL) models and image datasets can improve prototype performance and aid in planning sustainable SWM systems, particularly by leveraging pre-trained DL models (transfer learning).
